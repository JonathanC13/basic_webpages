# My Little Dumpling Shop
## Description
Bascially, my knowledge of full stack web development is fairly spotty with essentailly no experience with frontend libraries like react.js and tools like node.js.

My analytical prowess in basic HTML/CSS, JS, PHP, and SQL was servicable enough to be able to maintain and implement features for my previous job. 

For the fun of it, I want to see how many walls I can run straight into by starting web developemnt at square 1. This project is focused on HTML and sematics.
