Completed independently and then watched their implementation.

## Additional packages
1. abort-controller (https://www.npmjs.com/package/abort-controller)
    > npm install abort-controller -s

## To run
1. start json-server (Didn't need a db, but wanted to write fetching). Understandable CORS blocked for API so used own.
    > npm run server

2. run the app
