Idea from:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo
(5:44:46) Stripe sub menus

Completed independently and then watched their implementation.

## Additional packages
1. react-icons (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)
    > npm install react-icons --save

## To run
1. Install dependencies
    > npm install

2. run the app

**todo: 
    1. sliding transitions from navitem to navitem
    2. fade in for submenus
    3. better side menu fade in without modifying app
